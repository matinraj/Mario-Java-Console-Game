## Mario Java Console Game

This is a console-based game that utilizes Java and Object-Oriented Programming Design.

You may control Mario ‘m’ using your keyboard input. Actions and their corresponding keys will be made available depending on the environment. Users need to enter a number/letter corresponding to an action to play the game.

At every iteration, mario will be able to move/jump and collect coins ($) for exchange of tools. He may need to overcome obstacles (Trees/Walls) and get away from enemies (eg. Goomba)

For game OOP design justifications and UML diagrams, please refer to `Combined Design Document.pdf`
